# PatchesTheChaseBot

Materials:
  Arduino Uno (+ programming cable)
  Battery pack
  RedBot chassis (Sparkfun)
  CMUCam5 - Pixy (Charmed Labs)
  Breadboard, wires, resistors
  
Code:
  You will need to include the Pixy arduino library. The library that was originally used has been uploaded. Instructions on how to do this can be found online.
  
Picture:
  The pictures show two IR sensors to the left and right of the Pixy. These were NOT used but remained on the bot because someone had hot glued them to the chassis.
